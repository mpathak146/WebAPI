# DataloadService
A general dataload service for People System

At the heart of this development lies a complete automation of dataload services. Currently project team rely on development
team to process this from backend. Which is risky, resource expensive, and inefficient (because only limited number of requests can be processed).

This is being developed as a restful service as part of an asynchronous architecture that balances load using Azure queues 
to process requests.
